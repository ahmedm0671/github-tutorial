## Git vs. GitHub
The difference between Git and Github is that **Github** serve as a cloud to the repositories.
and has many of its own features. **Git** however is a command line tool that can be used in GitHub for coding.
Git helps keep track of all your work, and all the saves/commits and allows you to load back a previous save/commit

## Initial Setup
#### Making a Git Hub Account
* Go to [GitHub](github.com).
* Click on "Sign Up" at the top right of the page.
* Enter your credentials for creating an account: **Username, Email, Password**
* Choose your plan. You can either choose to have a **Paid** plan for added exclusive features, or have a **Free** plan with limited features.
* You can choose to tailor your **Experience**, or skip this step.

* Make sure you like it to your [c9](https://c9.io/) account, so you can sign in with your github instead of your c9 account everytime you log in.
